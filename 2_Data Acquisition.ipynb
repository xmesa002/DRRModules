The data is randomly divided into nominal scenes with a spacing of approximately 160km. Landsat data is collected in accordance with the World Wide Reference System (WRS), which has catalogued the world's land mass into 57,784 scenes, each 183 km wide by 170 km long (Jensen, 2005). These divisions facilitate querying satellite imagery over any portion of the world by specifying a nominal scene center designated by ‘path’ and ‘row’ numbers (Rocchio, June, 2011). When looking for a scene of a certain area, it can be obtained by using the path and row. If the path and row are not known, then the coordinates of the area of interest can be used. \n",
