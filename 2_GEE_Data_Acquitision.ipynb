    "The Central American Probabilistic Risk Assessment model for flood hazards is a secondary hazard model that requires spatially explicit runoff factors (Fig. 1).  Spatially explicit runoff values are determined from water evaporation and infiltration rates, which are a function of the land cover, land use and the soil characteristics of a location.  Hence, to produce a runoff factor (N) map it is essential to have a land cover map."

    "Landsat data is collected continuously along a near vertical path as the satellite moves from north to south. The data is randomly divided into nominal scenes with a spacing of approximately 160km. Landsat data is collected in accordance with the World Wide Reference System (WRS), which has catalogued the world's land mass into 57,784 scenes, each 183 km wide by 170 km long (Jensen, 2005). These divisions facilitate querying satellite imagery over any portion of the world by specifying a nominal scene center designated by ‘path’ and ‘row’ numbers (Rocchio, June, 2011). When looking for a scene of a certain area, it can be obtained by using the path and row. If the path and row are not known, then the coordinates of the area of interest can be used. \n",
